## Introduction
This repository features a series of Java projects completed during my internship at ShadowFox. Each project is designed to demonstrate different aspects of software development, from console-based applications to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), as well as unit testing practices.

## Projects

### Enhanced Console-based Calculator
- **Description**: A console application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as advanced scientific calculations such as square roots and exponentiation. It also includes functionalities for unit conversions, like temperature and currency.
- **Key Learning**: Gained experience in basic Java syntax, method creation, error handling, and implementation of mathematical operations. This project helped to solidify my understanding of user input handling and console output formatting.

### Simple Contact Management System
- **Description**: A command-line application for managing personal contacts. Users can add new contacts, view existing contacts, update details, and delete contacts as needed. The application stores contact information such as name, phone number, and email address in memory using ArrayLists.
- **Key Learning**: Developed skills in implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, managing user input and output, and utilizing Java collections for data storage.

### Bank Account Management System with Unit Testing
- **Description**: An application that simulates a bank account management system. Users can create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and view their transaction history. This project has been enhanced with JUnit tests to ensure the functionality of deposit and withdrawal methods, balance inquiries, and transaction history retrieval.
- **Key Learning**: Deepened my understanding of unit testing, test-driven development, and software testing principles. Gained experience in writing test cases to verify code functionality and ensure reliability.

### Inventory Management System with Basic GUI
- **Description**: A graphical user interface (GUI) application developed using JavaFX. This system allows users to manage inventory items, including adding, updating, and deleting items from the inventory. The interface is designed for usability, making it easy to navigate and interact with the application.
- **Key Learning**: Acquired skills in GUI design, event handling, and implementing CRUD operations within a graphical environment. This project highlighted the importance of user experience and interface design in software applications.

## Installation
To run the projects locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ShadowFox.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory of your choice:
   ```bash
   cd ShadowFox/[ProjectName]
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
4. Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

## Usage
- Each project has specific instructions in its respective directory on how to run the application.
- For console applications, you can run them from the terminal or command prompt after compiling the Java files.
- For the GUI application, you can run it directly from your IDE.
